In this video, I walk you through my entire creative process - from initial thumbnail sketches all the way to final digital artwork.

## What We Cover

- Initial brainstorming and thumbnail sketches
- Refining compositions
- Digital inking techniques
- Color theory and palette selection
- Adding those final touches

This is the workflow I've developed over years of trial and error. It's constantly evolving, but these core principles remain the same.
