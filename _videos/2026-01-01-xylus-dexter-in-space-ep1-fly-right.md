## Episode 1 of my animated cartoon series Xylus and Dexter in Space!

I watch a lot of cartoons and like to pause and view them frame by frame so I can study how they're made. I took some of the things I learned and wanted to try them out, so I decided to make my own series of cartoon shorts.

## Concept

Xylus and Dexter are traveling through space, flying above the planet Mars when a slight mishap causes them to land earlier than expected.

## Artwork

I spent more time on the layout of the storyboards for this series. I wanted to make sure I knew what everything was going to look like from the very beginning.
