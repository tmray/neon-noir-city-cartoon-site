Digital tools have revolutionized how we create comics, but there's something special about maintaining that hand-drawn aesthetic even when working digitally.

## My Process

1. **Sketch on paper** - Nothing beats the feel of pencil on paper for initial ideas
2. **Scan and clean** - Bring those sketches into the digital realm
3. **Ink digitally** - Using a tablet to get those bold, confident lines
4. **Color with intention** - Color theory matters! Think about mood and emotion

The key is to not let the digital tools make everything too "perfect." Embrace the wobble, the texture, the imperfections - that's where the personality lives.
