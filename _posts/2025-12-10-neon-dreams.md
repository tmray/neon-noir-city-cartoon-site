Urban environments have always fascinated me. There's something about the way neon lights reflect off wet pavement, how buildings create these canyon-like spaces, and the energy of people moving through it all.

## Finding Inspiration

I spend a lot of time just observing:

- The color palettes of old neon signs
- How shadows aren't just black - they're blue, purple, sometimes even green
- The contrast between organic human elements and rigid architecture
- That golden hour when everything glows

These observations make their way into my work, creating that "neon noir" vibe I'm always chasing.
