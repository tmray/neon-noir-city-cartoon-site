Hey there! Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I share my creative journey as an indie artist. This site is inspired by the vibrant, comic book aesthetic of Mission Hill - a show that perfectly captured that mix of urban energy and indie spirit.

## What You'll Find Here

I'll be posting a mix of content:

- **Blog posts** about my creative process, thoughts on art and storytelling
- **Videos** showcasing my work, tutorials, and behind-the-scenes content
- **Drawings** from my sketchbooks and finished pieces

## The Aesthetic

I wanted this site to feel like a printed zine mixed with comic book panels. Every element has that hand-crafted, slightly wonky feel - nothing is perfectly straight, borders are thick, and colors pop like neon signs in the city.

Stay tuned for more content coming soon!
