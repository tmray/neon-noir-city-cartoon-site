A quick sketch exploring neon signs, shadows, and that urban atmosphere. This one was inspired by a late-night walk through downtown.

The contrast between the warm glow of the neon and the cool shadows really captures that Mission Hill vibe I'm always chasing.

*Technical details: Digital ink with limited color palette - Bling-Blau Blue, Neon Orchid, and Toxic Lime.*
