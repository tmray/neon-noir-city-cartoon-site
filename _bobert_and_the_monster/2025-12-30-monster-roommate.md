This comic demonstrates both mobile viewing modes! On desktop, you'll see the full traditional comic page. On mobile, you can toggle between:

- **Panel View**: Swipe through one panel at a time (like Webtoon)
- **Full Page View**: Scroll and pinch to zoom in on details

The panel-by-panel view is perfect for reading text and seeing details on small screens, while the full page view lets you appreciate the overall composition if you want the traditional experience.
