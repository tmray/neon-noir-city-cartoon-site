# Character Information
characters:
  - name: "Bobert"
    description: "An everyday guy trying to live a normal life in a not-so-normal city. He's optimistic, a little naive, and surprisingly chill about having a monster for a roommate. Works a day job, dreams of something more, and usually ends up in situations he didn't sign up for."
    
  - name: "Monster"
    description: "Bobert's mysterious roommate who happens to be a monster. Secretive, paranoid (hence the 17 locks), but ultimately good-hearted. Has a complicated past they'd rather not talk about and an even more complicated present. Likes pizza, hates surprises."
    
  - name: "You (Sort Of)"
    description: "The protagonist of \"Then This Happened\" is basically all of us – trying to get through the day without spilling coffee on our laptops, dealing with everyday absurdities, and wondering why life has to be this way. You know, relatable chaos."

# Artist/Creator Bio
artist:
  paragraphs:
    - "Hey! I'm the cartoonist behind HomeMade Cartoons. I create comics and illustrations inspired by everyday life, Mission Hill aesthetics, and the beautiful chaos of city living."
    - "My work blends hand-drawn comic art with digital tools, aiming for that indie zine feel – a little wonky, a lot colorful, and always authentic. I'm influenced by classic comic strips, indie comics, and the neon-noir vibe of shows like Mission Hill."
    - "When I'm not drawing comics, I'm probably spilling coffee (inspiration for \"Then This Happened\"), watching animated shows, or wandering around the city looking for the next story to tell."
    - "This site is my creative playground – a place to share comics, drawings, videos of my process, and random thoughts about art and life. Thanks for stopping by Cosmopolis!"
