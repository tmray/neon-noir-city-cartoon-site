      <div class="about-content">
        <p>An ongoing series following Bobert, an ordinary guy who discovers his new roommate is... well, a monster. But not the scary kind. More like the "has 17 locks on their door and questionable life choices" kind.</p>
        <p>Follow their adventures as they navigate roommate dynamics, city life, and the occasional supernatural weirdness that comes with living in Cosmopolis.</p>

        <h3 class="character-name">Bobert</h3>
        <p class="character-description">An everyday guy trying to live a normal life in a not-so-normal city. He's optimistic, a little naive, and surprisingly chill about having a monster for a roommate. Works a day job, dreams of something more, and usually ends up in situations he didn't sign up for.</p>

        <h3 class="character-name">Monster</h3>
        <p class="character-description">Bobert's mysterious roommate who happens to be a monster. Secretive, paranoid (hence the 17 locks), but ultimately good-hearted. Has a complicated past they'd rather not talk about and an even more complicated present. Likes pizza, hates surprises.</p>

        <h3 class="character-name">You (Sort Of)</h3>
        <p class="character-description">The protagonist of "Then This Happened" is basically all of us – trying to get through the day without spilling coffee on our laptops, dealing with everyday absurdities, and wondering why life has to be this way. You know, relatable chaos.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">About the Artist</h2>
    
    <div class="about-content">
      <p>Hey! I'm the cartoonist behind HomeMade Cartoons. I create comics and illustrations inspired by everyday life, Mission Hill aesthetics, and the beautiful chaos of city living.</p>
      
      <p>My work blends hand-drawn comic art with digital tools, aiming for that indie zine feel – a little wonky, a lot colorful, and always authentic. I'm influenced by classic comic strips, indie comics, and the neon-noir vibe of shows like Mission Hill.</p>
      
      <p>When I'm not drawing comics, I'm probably spilling coffee (inspiration for "Then This Happened"), watching animated shows, or wandering around the city looking for the next story to tell.</p>
      
      <p>This site is my creative playground – a place to share comics, drawings, videos of my process, and random thoughts about art and life. Thanks for stopping by Cosmopolis!</p>
